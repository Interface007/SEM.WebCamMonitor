# SEM.WebCamMonitor

Just a very simple PowerShell script to monitor MS-Teams for webcam activity, activate a Shelly Switch when webcam is on and switch it off when webcam is off.

I am using a simple ["Shelly Plus Plug S"](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BTJ1DTBX) which is configured to show the color "red" when it's on.
